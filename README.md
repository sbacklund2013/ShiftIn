##### About the Project

For as long as "car guys" has been on the internet there have been car websites. Today you do not even have to buy a repair manual because someone somewhere has dealt with the same issue and wrote a post about it on some website. This has created thriving online communities of enthusiasts, but they are all on different sites. If you own a Honda Civic then you are on some civic forum, if you own a Ford Mustang, then you on the Mustang forums. Having got into cars myself in the last couple of years I found it so strange there was not a platform for all car people, together. I have seen various apps pop up here and there that try to catch the market, but it is never executed correctly. The apps focus on monetization and being as close to Instagram as possible while still maintaining a car-like theme. All these apps and websites were missing some core features that enthusiasts seem to like a Garage profile (where you can list your cars etc), a categorized forum (where you can post questions and find answers), and a meet maker (where users can schedule live events and meet up). Overall, Shiftin seeks to bring together all these amazing car forums into one community site where users can ask questions, create events, show off their cars, and meet new people.
